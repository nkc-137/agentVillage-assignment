# Test trust boundaries by talking to an agent as owner, then as stranger.
# Trust context is determined server-side by matching user_id to agent's owner_id.
#
# Demonstrates that:
#   1. Owner (user_id matches owner_id) can store private memories
#   2. Stranger (user_id doesn't match) doesn't reveal private information
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test_trust_boundary.sh                          # Luna, default URL
#   ./scripts/test_trust_boundary.sh <agent-id>               # custom agent
#   ./scripts/test_trust_boundary.sh <agent-id> <base-url>    # custom agent + URL
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - The FastAPI server must be running:
#       uvicorn app.main:app --reload
#   - curl and python3 (for JSON formatting) must be available
